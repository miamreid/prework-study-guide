           <h2>HTML</h2>
           <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> gives a web application the content structure. It is essentially like building the frame to a house. It is made up of elements that work together to provide content and the basic framwork of all pages on the web.</p>
          
          <p>At the top of the webpage, we see the !DOCTYPE html declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is open. The DOCTYPE is not case-senstiive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</p>
           <h3>Elements</h3>
           <p>An element is a type of content on a webpage. Common elements include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Text elements</li>
                <li>Image elements</li>
                <li>Header elements</li>
                <li>List elements (like this one!)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition to <strong>elements that can be seen on the page</strong>, elements are also used to divide the content on a page to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</p>
              <p>Element types that are used to divide and describe:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Meta-related elements</li>
                  <li>Content division elements</li>
                  <li>Semantic elements</li>
                  </ul>
              <h4>Head element</h4>
              <p>The head element contains information about the webpage, or <strong>metadata</strong>, that helps the browser render the page correctly. Elements within the head are not visible to the user.</p>
             <p><strong>Metadata</strong> is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The style element defines the CSS styles applied to the page.</li>
                <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
                <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
                <li>The meta element defines character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
                <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In our example of the Panda Fan site, the meta element defines:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The charset, or character set, as UTF-8, which allows us to use most characters and symbols on the page.</li>
                <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
                <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Body element</h4>
              <p>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</p>
              <h4>Section elements</h4>
              <p>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</p>

              <p>HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</p>
          </section>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><strong>CSS, Cascading Style Sheets,</strong> is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to others. CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</p>

    <p>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use <strong>inline CSS.</strong> They are useful for quick and premanent changes but are less flexible than external an internal style sheets.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to embed a stylesheet directly in the HTML file using the style element that is nested in the head. The rules only apply to the page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs.</p>

    <p>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an <strong>external CSS style sheet</strong>. When using an external style sheet, link the file using a link element placed in the head element.</p>
    
    <h3>CSS Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declaratations apply.</li>
      <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
      <li>A period preceding the class designates it as a class selector.</li>
      <li><strong>Declarations</strong> contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
    <p>Think of every HTML element as a box. Each box consists of <strong>margins</strong> outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the <strong>outside</strong> of an element.</li>
      <li>The padding property adds space around the content <strong>inside</strong> an element. When you increase padding, you are making the element bigger.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DRY Code</h3>
    <p>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code helps keep code as succint as possible. Developers often combine two or more selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma.</p>

    <h3>CSS Properties &amp; Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A display property assigned with a block values tells an element to start on a new line.</li>
      <li>The rel attribute in a link element specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document source.</li>
      <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple effects can be separated by commas</li>
          <li>A box shadow is descibed by X and Y offsets relative to the emene,t blue and spread radius, and color.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
      <li>git add -A: adds code to the working branch to the staging area. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
      <li>git commit: entered with a commit message (-m "commit message") that describes what the commit contains.</li>
      <li>git pull origin < branch name >: receives a branch's modifications to the local environment, with the origin indicating the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The fourth keyword "main" indicates the branch.</li>
      <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: Pushes changes to the remote branch. Push pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with webiste. Through JavaScript, you can power webistes with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
   <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
   <li>Arrays can be used to store data types, and a for loop can be used to operate on each element in an array.</li>
   <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</p>
    <p>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
      <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
      <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
