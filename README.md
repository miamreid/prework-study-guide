# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In order to practice the skills learned during the course of my Coding bootcamp, I have created a study guide webpage that will also serve as a guide to other bootcamp students. The study guide can be easily referenced to find answers for questions involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It can also be used as a quick reference and cheat sheet for different elements in the languages learned during my bootcamp Prework. I learned how to structure webpages using HTML, how to style the page using CSS, and how to write and call functions using JavaScript.

## Usage

The different sections of the study guide page include notes and examples for each language covered during our Prework lessons, including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

When viewers open the DevTools console, they will also be propted with a topic to study first, which is run by a JavaScript function within the page.
